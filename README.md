Hi! This is the github repository of the R package "dogss", which is short for DOuble-Group Sparse Spike-and-slab, a Bayesian feature selection method. It takes advantage of known group structure of the features, where sparsity is assumed on the between-group and within-group levels. Thus it is very similar to the idea of the "sparse-group lasso". Implementation is much faster than your typical Bayesian method, since we employed a deterministic algorithm called expectation propagation instead of the stochastic and slow Gibbs sampling.
