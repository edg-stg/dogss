Title: Sparse-Group Bayesian Feature Selection with Expectation Propagation
Version: 1.0
Author: Edgar Steiger
Maintainer: Edgar Steiger <edgar.steiger@gmail.com>
Description: Given a response vector y and data matrix X as well as a grouping of features G, this recovers a vector of coefficients beta with y = X*beta + error, where beta is sparse on a between- and within-group level.
    The algorithm to recover the parameters is called expectation propagation and is much faster than Gibbs sampling.
